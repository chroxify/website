## [2023] My personal website
This is the source code of my personal website from 2023. It is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Preview it at https://2023.chroxify.com

## Getting started
If you wish to use my website as a template for your own, you are totally welcome to do so. 

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/chroxify/website.git && cd website
```

### 2. Install dependencies
- pnpm: ```pnpm install``` (Recommended)
- npm: ```npm install```
- yarn: ```yarn install```

### 3. Run the development server
- pnpm: ```pnpm dev``` (Recommended)
- npm: ```npm run dev```
- yarn: ```yarn dev```

### 4. Open the website
Now you can open the local website at http://localhost:3000 and start editing the files.
I store most of the personal information in the ```config``` directory so you can easily change it to your own.

### 5. Deploy the website
After you are done editing the website to your liking, you can easily import it to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/import) and deploy it for free.
